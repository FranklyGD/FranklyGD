### Welcome to my profile!

I'm a programmer by hobby looking forward to use my skills and curiosity to help myself and others learn about thing we are passionate about.

I mainly work on the following often than others that I believe to be useful:

* [Spyro Scope](https://github.com/FranklyGD/Spyro-Scope)
  *A program that looks at a running PS1 Spyro game in an emulator*
* ***And more in the future...***
